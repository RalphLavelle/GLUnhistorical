## Build the app to verify the work
Always build the project, front-end and back-end after applying any changes, to verify that the changes have been successful.

## Verify style changes in the browser
If there have been any front-end changes verify that there are no mistakes by running the app in the browser. If there any javascript or less errors, fix them before verifying again.
