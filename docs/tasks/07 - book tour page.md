# Book a tour form

## The form
There should be a book a tour form, which asks for a person's name, email address, number in the party, and date preferred (using a pop-up calendar).

## Linking to the form
The form should be linked to from:
* the header
* the bottom of the individual places component
* the button on the front page which currently links to nothing

## Saving the data
Once submitted, the form information should be saved into the data folder in a json file called tourists.

## Acknowledgment
A 'thank you' panel should show when the form has been successfully saved, but it should disappear after 5 seconds. The form should also disappear. A button should allow the user to redirect back to all places
