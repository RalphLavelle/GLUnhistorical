# Hosting options

## Where to host
Research hosting options for this site, keeping in mind it's an Angular site, using Node as back-end. MongoDB is used as the database, but will be hosted separately.

## Cost is a factor
If possible, prioritise providers with free trial options. If this site is successful, we can pay for hosting later. 

The site will need to host hundreds of photographs on disk, most of which won't exceed 100kb in size, however.

The site will need to be regularly updated, and this should be as straightforward as possible.

For any hosting options you discover, please provide detailed instructions on how to upload the site to that cloud provider. If necessary, We can use containerisation.

## No dedicated domain name
For the time being, this site can do without its own dedicated domain name. That can come later.
