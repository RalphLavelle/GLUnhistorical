# Compile a list of places

## Research phase
Research the top 25 places in Surfers Paradise on Queensland's Gold Coast (Australia) that people on a walking tour could easily visit. Preference should be given to quirky, unusual locations, preferably with a photogenic sculpture or some sort of easily recogisable image. Save this research into a JSON file called places in '/Data', with a link to a photo of each, its name, and a description of a couple of hundred words. The location of each place is also important, since the place will need to be able to be placed on a (Google) map.
