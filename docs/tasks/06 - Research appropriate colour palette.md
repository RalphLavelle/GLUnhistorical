# Appropriate colour palette

Given that the them of the site is a the Gold Coast, with its beaches, sand and surf, the colour palette should reflect this. Can you research appropriate colour palettes to use? I'm looking for 4-5 colours that are thematically right and that work well together.

## Separate palettes stylesheet
Can you provide 5 distint palette options in a stylesheet called themes that give me the option to toggle each colour palette for the entire site bu simply renaming a variable?
